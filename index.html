		<p id="hometext">Pizza Land was founded in June of 1998 as a family restaurant and our goals were serve the best foods with a dedication to proper preparation according to Halal practice. Starting up was very hard because of shortage of halal supplier but we made it and start growing the business by serving the proper preparation according to the practice and always remain a greater part of our service and dedication. Our food will not only meet your gourmet demands but most of all give our friends peace of mind and there for foods that you can trust. We are now newly renovate it and got 70 seat to serve you. Our food selection and variety can very well satisfy each member of the family.Pizza Land is an independently owned pizzeria located at 260 Belleville Turnpike in North Arlington, New Jersey, which featured in the opening credits of The Sopranos. Additionally, in Law and Order episode 10.6, "Marathon" (1999), a pizza box from the restaurant was used by a suspect to transport and conceal firearms. The pizzeria was opened in 1965 by Italian immigrant Frank DiPiazza, who died in 1991. It was owned by pizza maker Al Pawlowicz until his death in 2010, who purchased the restaurant from DiPiazza's son. The store is now owned by Eddie Twdroos</p>

<article id="history">
		<p id="historytext">Pizzaland (Associated Restaurants) was founded in 1970 by David Dutton, financed by Associated Newspapers. The chain rapidly expanded throughout London, and then into the Northwest. The first restaurant outside London was opened in Deansgate, Manchester; from its northern/southern base Pizzaland grew into a chain of over 140 restaurants before United Biscuits acquired the company in 1980. Jullian Griffiths, Greg Barwick and Michael Stidolph were the senior managers responsible for the successful growth of the company in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1983, a total change in senior management and a change in siting policy, that often resulted in Pizzaland opening in towns that were too small to support them, started the decline of a once successful business.In the late 1980s the chain aggressively tried to boost revenues with discount cut-out coupons in British tabloid newspapers; vouchers were often given to patrons for future visits. The most popular of these was the "pizza for a penny" scheme, whereby customers could purchase one pizza and obtain another of equal or lesser value for 1p. While an initial success, the offer ultimately backfired since it became an expectation for customers, many of whom would no longer use the chain unless they could source a coupon. The "pizza for a penny" strategy came to be regarded as a major catalyst in the demise of Pizzaland in the UK</p>
